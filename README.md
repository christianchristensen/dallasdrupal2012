## Jekyll / deck.js Presentation Template

* Write your presentation under in talk.md.
* Run `make`
* Your presentation will be under `_site`, with
  [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) included.

### TODO

*  Replace (or plugify?) deck.js and reveal.js
*  live examples of curl basic, session, and oauth (oauth signing tool - PHP app?))
*  HTTP examples: demo browser and how to "see" these things
*  move "what oauth looks like to front?
*  Use public/private key hashing video to demonstrate what is going on here...
*  Fill in URL patterns on technical slide to docs on twitter, fb, goog, AP,...
