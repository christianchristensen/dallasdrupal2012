What about that guy ([Eran Hammer](http://hueniverse.com/oauth/)) on the internet that was like "OAuth 2.0 sucks" **!!rage quit!!** ?!!

Agree or disgree â€¦ most importantly: he's an expert and is prosthelytizing great information - **Listen to him!** (and read carefully)

But, dont throw the baby out with the bathwater and his commentary is directed at the 2.0 *draft*
